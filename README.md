# Your Language, My Language, Our Language: Studying International Auxiliary Languages in Wikipedia with Data Science.

This is the official repository where all the code for this research project is located. For a complete detail of
all the relevant aspects of the project, including contact information, consult our official page in the 
Wikimedia research page.

## Requirements

The code is written in Python and we make use of the libraries:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [Powerlaw](https://pypi.org/project/powerlaw/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

## Datasets

All the code is based on datasats retrieved from [Quarry](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Quarry). 
Here is where you can find them:
